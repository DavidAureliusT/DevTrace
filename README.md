# DevTrace Desktop 

It is a developer’s personal mission control — a desktop app that captures every stage of the software development lifecycle in one place.

It centralizes project documentation, code insights, debugging notes, and deployment records into a single, searchable workspace. Each project moves through defined phases — backend, frontend, integration, testing, deployment — letting you trace how ideas evolve into working systems.

The app integrates with GitHub to automatically sync commits and issues, builds visual Gantt charts to map your workflow over time, and supports exporting reports for retrospectives or client updates.

In short: it’s part documentation tool, part reflection journal, part timeline of your growth as a developer. It replaces scattered notes and forgotten lessons with an organized system that actually mirrors how developers work — not how managers wish they did.

User stories. The part where we pretend everyone works rationally and not at 2 a.m. chasing a deployment bug. Fine — let’s turn your *DevTrace Desktop* personas into something the agile gods would approve of.

# Development Plan

## 🧠 **Epic 1: Manage Development Projects**

**As a reflective developer,**
I want to create and manage projects inside DevTrace
**so that** I can organize all my notes, commits, and insights per project.

2. As a user, I can define workflow phases (backend, frontend, integration, testing, deployment).
3. As a user, I can switch between phases and log entries under the current phase.
4. As a user, I can archive or mark projects as completed.

## 🧩 **Epic 4: Reflect and Learn**

**As a curious developer,**
I want to write short “learning notes” linked to what I was working on
**so that** I can build my own technical knowledge base.

**Stories**

1. As a user, I can quickly create “What I learned” entries.
2. As a user, I can tag learning entries by topic (e.g., Laravel, Vue, debugging).
3. As a user, I can filter and view my learnings by tag or date.
4. As a user, I can connect learning entries to past issues or commits.

## 🧪 **Epic 5: Track Deployment and Production**

**As a developer responsible for releases,**
I want to log deployments and production issues
**so that** I can trace what changed and when problems appeared.

**Stories**

1. As a user, I can record a deployment (version, date, environment).
2. As a user, I can link a deployment to a GitHub release or branch.
3. As a user, I can log post-deployment incidents and resolutions.
4. As a user, I can view deployment history per project.

## 📊 **Epic 6: Visualize with Gantt Chart**

**As a developer or team lead,**
I want to generate and export a Gantt chart
**so that** I can visualize project phases and share timelines easily.

**Stories**

1. As a user, I can generate a Gantt chart from recorded phase data.
2. As a user, I can adjust start and end dates manually.
3. As a user, I can export the chart as PNG or PDF.
4. As a user, I can export raw data as JSON or CSV for further analysis.

---

## ☁️ **Epic 7: Sync & Backup**

**As a developer who values my data,**
I want to back up and sync my projects
**so that** I never lose my logs or insights.

**Stories**

1. As a user, I can authenticate with a remote Laravel API.
2. As a user, I can sync local data with my cloud storage.
3. As a user, I can restore projects from backup.

## 💡 **Epic 8: Insight & Reporting**

**As a reflective developer,**
I want DevTrace to summarize my work
**so that** I can see patterns and improve my workflow.

**Stories**

1. As a user, I can view statistics on bug types, commit frequency, and lessons logged.
2. As a user, I can view time spent in each workflow phase.
3. As a user, I can generate a project summary report (PDF or Markdown).

This backlog of user stories gives you structure without strangling creativity.
You could survive months on just Epics 1–4 and have something genuinely useful.
The rest turns it from “personal dev log” into “developer’s black box recorder.”
